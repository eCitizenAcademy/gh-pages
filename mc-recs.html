Management Council Recommendations<br>
IDESG Workplan and Priority Objectives:
<p>
Relevant Provisions from the Executive Summary:
<p>
1. Establishment of the IDESG Accreditation Program 
<p>
2. Merging and re-chartering of the Trust Framework Committee, the Accreditation Coordination Committee, and the Legal Committee into a single entity. It will be capable of addressing the fundamental questions surrounding the development of an accreditation program, the incorporation of existing Trust Frameworks, and the legal issues surrounding these topics.
<p>
Priority Objectives Section
<p>
A. Establish and Implement an IDESG Self-Sustainment Plan The IDESG must be established as a legal entity with a sustainable business plan, funding model, and revenue streams by the close of 2013. Any delays in this process could jeopardize the future of the IDESG and the Identity Ecosystem.
<p>
B. Establish and Implement an IDESG Accreditation and Trustmark Program This is an essential step in the development of the Identity Ecosystem as specified in the NSTIC strategy document. Delays in implementing this program may endanger the attraction and continued participation of key stakeholders. 
<p>
C. Implement IDESG Accreditation Program for at least 2 NSTIC Pilots This integrates the pilots with the IDESG and implements the Identity Ecosystem. It will demonstrate operational capability to key stakeholders and members of the community. While there is no stated requirement in the language of the pilot grants to do so, the SC believes that such a proposal would be welcome all around, whether for current or future pilots. 
<p>
D. Establish Defined Liaison Relationships This will incorporate essential stakeholders, such as Standards Development Organizations and Trust Frameworks, who may find liaising with the IDESG as an optimal operating relationship. 
<p>
E. Establish and Implement the Identity Ecosystem Framework Development and Adoption Process This will be the development of a whole lifecycle process – from initial expression of concerns and needs; to development of use cases and formalization of requirements; identifying and selecting policies, standards and procedures; and assessing conformance with the NSTIC Guiding Principles – necessary to establish and operate the target Framework. The SC highlights that no committee is currently taking leadership on this over-arching piece of work. It could fit within the work plan of the proposed new committee covering trust frameworks, accreditation and legal issues (see below) but could also be something the Management Council itself leads or provides input and leadership to.
<p>

Relevant Provisions from “Structural Adjustments” Section
<p>
Trust Framework Committee, Accreditation Coordination Committee, and Legal Committee 
<p>
The SC found significant potential overlap of the workplans of these committees. The Trust Framework (TF) and Accreditation Committees (ACC) have been meeting jointly for several months; however, they have chosen to maintain separate charters and leadership. On an unrelated note, the chairs of TF and ACC Committees have been unable to sign the new IDESG membership agreements, leaving both currently without leadership.
<p>
While the legal committee has leadership and will have a charter prepared for the upcoming vote, the majority of its work directly contributes to the TF and ACC efforts. It also lacks the substantive membership of the other committees.  In order to maximize efficiency, leadership, and resources, the SC recommends these three committees be formally combined, re-chartered, and elect new leadership. This combined committee’s efforts will be essential to developing the Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF), and the IDESG’s Accreditation and Certification Program, one of the organization’s primary objectives according to the NSTIC. The SC further recommends that this committee be assigned the responsibility of maintaining completeness and consistency of the IDEF.
<p>
Recommendations:
•  Combine the three committees<br>
•	Re-charter and elect new leadership<br>
•	Assign IDEF development, coordination and maintenance responsibilities to the consolidated committee
<p>
Sector Specific Committees (Health Care/Financial Services)
<p>
The SC recommends that these sector specific committees remain in place as they are currently structured. While it is not anticipated that they will directly develop IDEF components, it is anticipated that they will actively contribute to the development of sector specific use cases, requirements, business development, and outreach. These committees should act as a conduit to ensure that key stakeholder groups in the ecosystem continue to have an active role in the IDESG.
<p>
Recommendation: 
•	Continue to maintain these committees
<br>
•	Consider establishing new sector committees, as needed, to promote new use cases and galvanize markets for use of the target ecosystem framework, for  example: eCommerce/Retail and eGovernment
