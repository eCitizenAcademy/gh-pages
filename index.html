<p>Commencing at 2pm Eastern Time, April 15th, 2011, an HTML version of NSTIC will be available at: <a title="link to html version of NSTIC" href="http://nstic.us/strategy.html" target="_blank">http://nstic.us/strategy.html</a>&nbsp; NSTIC.US, as a public service, will publish the entire NSTIC document in HTML format, including tags to each paragraph making it simple to cite to specific  sections of text within the strategy.&nbsp; We hope this will facilitate  broader dialog about the various aspects of the strategy by making it  easy to include a cite in the form of a link directly to the language  being discussed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about our usage of the &lt;cite&gt; tag to enable simple granular html-based citation links directly to each section, paragraph, list and other item within the NSTIC document, please read "<a title="embedded self-cites post" href="http://ecitizenproject.org/ideafactory/embedded-self-citations" target="_blank">Embedded Self-Cites</a>", by Daniel Bennett, CTO of the <a title="eCitizen" href="http://ecitizenfoundation.org" target="_blank">eCitizen Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Over time, additional relevant information will be linked to and from this HTML document.</p>
